## Problem Name: Max Perfectness of String
### Problem Difficulty: None
#### Problem Constraints: 
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6

#### Problem Description:
Sanket has a string consisting of only 'a' and 'b' as the characters. Sanket describes perfectness of a string as the maximum length substring of equal characters. Sanket is given a number **k** which denotes the maximum number of characters he can change. Find the maximum perfectness he can generate by changing no more than **k** characters.

#### Input Format: 
The first line contains an integer denoting the value of K.
The next line contains a string having only ‘a’ and ‘b’ as the characters.
* Sample Input: 
<pre>
2
abba
</pre>

#### Output Format: 
A single integer denoting the maximum perfectness achievable.
* Sample Output:
<pre> 
4
</pre>
